<li>extracting the coordinates of the wrist joint</li>
<li>Passing the coordinates to the unity game files using UDP</li>
<li>Passing the position of the player object as the coordinates of the wrist</li>

<H3>Hand detection using Mediapipe</H3>
<p>MediaPipe is a cross-platform pipeline framework to build custom machine learning solutions for live and streaming media. The framework was open-sourced by Google and is currently in the alpha stage.</p>
<p>The main reason to use mediapipe is that it is easy to learn and though in the alpha stage is extremly reliable.
